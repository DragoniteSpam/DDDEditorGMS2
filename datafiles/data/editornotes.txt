To Do - Now

When moving around a group of selected entities with the mouse, un-batch them and add them to a temporary
"mobile" batch instead so they don't have to get re-batched every time you move things just a little bit
 - which would slow things down quite a lot when moving a large number of entities

In the Autotile Editor tab, the button that says "click for autotile" spawns a dialog that lets you
select an autotile, with a button that says "Autotile Data" . . . which opens a dialog that's almost
exactly the same. The button should instead just open a file selector.

Autotiles

the reconfigure code doesn't work properly in all cases. pretty sure the math to calculate the
surroundings is correct but (1) not all of the Stuff.autotile_hash values have been added, and (2)
the program does not correctly loop through all of the adjacent autotiles to recalculate their
surroundings value, and (3) it's not efficient. bulk selections (rectangle and circle) can get away
with setting the values of all of the internal tiles to CENTER, since we already know they will be
surrounded on all four sides with the same autotiles

also remember they should be animated.

when they get exported they should stay as autotiles. they don't need to be able to reconfigure
themselves during runtime but some of them may need to be animated.

Loadable Assets

 - Meshes (global)
 - Tilesets (per map) - texture 0
 - autotiles (per map) - texture 0
 - particle graphics (global) - texture 1
 - audio (global)
 - npc images (global) - texture 2
 - monster images (global) - texture 3

Game Maker texture pages can go up to 8192x8192, although i'd rather not because those will decompress
	to up to 250 mb each (the 4192x4192 texture pages will only be 67 mb, much better) - all four
	of the main texture pages combined will be about 250 mb instead

Global Texture (2) - global

particles and other graphics may take up half of it: up to 2048 64x64 particle graphics would take
	up 4096x2048, which sounds like a lot, except animated particles can add up quickly so it
	may fill up faster than you expect

NPC Texture (3) - global

npcs should probably not be more than 256x256, so you could fit up to 256 of them on the NPC texture
	page, which sounds like a lot except something tells me it might not be too hard to push the
	limit

Followers Texture (4) - global

because there are probably goign to be a lot of these, they also get their own texture page. because
	there are probably going to be a lot of them, subject them to more rigorous size constraints.
	64x128 ought to do it (they're normally composed of 6 32x32 images). you can fit 2048 of these
	on a texture page.

Entities

old notes
-----------------------------

Doing stuff with the selection:
 - copy contents
 - cut contents (copy and delete originals)
 - paste contents
 - bulk move

Properties: Map
 - width, height, depth
 - tileset used

Now:
 - when you change selection from mesh to something that is not mesh,
hide the mesh selector and swap in the appropriate options (tile picker
for tiles, mob type probably, effect type probably)
 - selecting an entitymesh should show the whole bounding box, not just
the footprint; mobs and particles should probably be similar
 - probably some other stuff
 - talk to relic people?

 - better deleting mechanism (instead of ds_list_delete-ing constantly, it
would probably be faster to re-create the list)
